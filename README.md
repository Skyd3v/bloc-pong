Pong A trip back to the 1970s!

This was an assignment done for the Bloc bootcamp. The goal was to create a game based on the classic arcade Pong.
While doing this project, I was exposed to OOP concepts and had to do the following tasks:

1)Make sure that a player can control one of the bars
2)Create colllisions for the ball once it hit the bars
3)Create an AI where it would try and block a person from scoring
4)Adjust the pace of the ball depending on how the game is going or who is winning
5)When the game arrives 11 points a winner is declared and a new game has to start.

Feel free to play along
